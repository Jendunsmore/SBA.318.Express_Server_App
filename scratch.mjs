// Requirements
// 1. Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.
// 2. Create and use error-handling middleware.
// 3. Use at least 3 different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments).
// 4. Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.
// 5. Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.
// 6. Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category
// should allow for client creation via a POST request.
// 7. Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data
// category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.
// 8. Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category
// should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.
// 9. Include query parameters for data filtering, where appropriate. At least one
// data category should allow for additional filtering through the use of query parameters.
// Note: DO NOT use API keys; this makes it more difficult for instructors to grade finished
// projects efficiently.
// 10. Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.
// 11. Adhere to the guiding principles of REST.
// 12. Create and render at least one view using a view template and template
// engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine. If you are
// stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state
// of your API's data for easy viewing.
// 13. Use simple CSS to style the rendered views. Note: This is not a test of design;
// it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be very simple.
// 14. Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API.
// 15. Utilize reasonable code organization practices.
// * I will go in and add CSS styles etc. (front end) work to app once back-end is up and working.
// *** Just work on POST requests on forms - HTML does NOT support patch or delete
// ** Do not show API

//-------------------------------------
// 1. create server.mjs file
// 2. npm init -y - creates package.json
// 3. correct package.json
// 4. npm i express - download express
// 5. import express at top of page
// 6. Initialize express into a variable
// 7. Listen to express(app) at the BOTTOM of the page

//---------------------------------------
/*
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
*/

// Initialize Express:
//  const app = express();
//  let PORT = 3000;

// routes
// listener
// middleware - custom
// middleware - error handling
// query params
// form - view template, template engine
// interactive form on render
